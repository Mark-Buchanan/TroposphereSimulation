# TroposphereSimulation
Idealized simulation of the Earth's troposphere using the Monte Carlo method (metropolis algorithm).

Simulation parameters editable starting at line ~30 and the random number generator can be chosen
from the defined functions on line ~180.  Code as is is set up for a representative simulation of the
troposphere, but will take a long time to run.  Significantly reduce both the number of particles, N,
and the number of iterations, iterations, to run quicker.

This was a self-designed and created final project for an upper year computational physics course at 
the University of Toronto.  All code is my own.  The methods utilised are sourced from "Computational 
Physics" by Mark Newman.
